# Project background
# What is web3 ?
	refers to decentralized apps that run on the blockchain. These are apps that allow anyone to participate without monetizing their personal data.
# Core ideas od web3 :
Web3 is decentralized: instead of large swathes of the internet controlled and owned by centralized entities, ownership gets distributed amongst its builders and users.
Web3 is permissionless: everyone has equal access to participate in Web3, and no one gets excluded.
Web3 has native payments: it uses cryptocurrency for spending and sending money online instead of relying on the outdated infrastructure of banks and payment processors.
Web3 is trustless: it operates using incentives and economic mechanisms instead of relying on trusted third parties.

# Web 3.0 applications
With blockchain at the foundation, Web 3.0 enables a growing number of different types of new applications and services to existing, including the following:

NFT. Nonfungible tokens (NFTs) are tokens that are stored in a blockchain with a cryptographic hash, making the token unit unique.
DeFi. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging use case for Web 3.0 where decentralized blockchain enables financial services outside the confines of traditional centralized banking infrastructure.
Cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are Web 3.0 applications that create a new world of currency that aims to be separate from the historical world of fiat currency.
dApp. Decentralized applications (dApps) are built on top of blockchain and use smart contracts to enable service delivery in a programmatic approach that is logged in an immutable ledger.
Cross-chain bridges. There are multiple blockchains in the Web 3.0 world, and enabling a degree of interoperability across them is the domain of cross-chain bridges.
DAOs. DAOs are set to potentially become the organizing entities for Web 3.0 services, providing some structure and governance in a decentralized approach.

# Objective:
In this project, I will build end-to-end Web3 dapps on the Algorand Blockchain that helps 10 Academy generate and distribute Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as certificates that will represent the successful completion of a weekly challenge to trainees, and allow trainees with NFTs to interact with a smart contract to perform pre-defined actions. I will use Algorand Blockchain as the foundational element of the NFT.
# What Is Algorand?
Algorand (ALGO) is both a digital currency and blockchain platform. The Algorand platform is designed to process many transactions quickly, similar to major payment processors like Mastercard or Visa. In addition, Algorand can host other cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based projects, making it a direct competitor to Ethereum. ALGO, the platform's native currency, is used to secure the Algorand blockchain and pay processing fees for Algorand-based transactions.
Algorand is an open-source blockchain, meaning anyone can view and contribute to the platform's code. Algorand uses an operating protocol it calls pure proof-of-stake (PPoS), which recruits network validators from the pool of users.
